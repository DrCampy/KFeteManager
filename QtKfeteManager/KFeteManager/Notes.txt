1) Could we have several open sessions ?
2) What happens if we delete a session from salesessions but it is still in config as current session ? -> Trigger "Cannot delete current session."

3) Buffer some requests ?

4) Have only some basic commands in Database and have all the specifications (client, articles, ...) in the corresponding classes.
   We could have (in database or so) an enum for the fields of such classes
5) Date d'ouverture de la session dans la barre en bas.

RGPD, do not display client's infos unless password entered ?
