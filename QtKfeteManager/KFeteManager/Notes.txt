1) Could we have several open sessions ?
2) What happens if we delete a session from salesessions but it is still in config as current session ? -> Trigger "Cannot delete current session."

3) Buffer some requests ?

4) Have only some basic commands in Database and have all the specifications (client, articles, ...) in the corresponding classes.
   We could have (in database or so) an enum for the fields of such classes
5) Date d'ouverture de la session dans la barre en bas.

Edit carte : disable "Validate" if no article selected

RGPD, do not display client's infos unless password entered ?

Make 2 executables. Gui and (cli ?) config.
Config executable : Only by sudo/admin or ask for pin ?
Asks for pin
allow changes of pin and other passes
Select money and number of different notes and coins and their value

TODO deal with already existing clients when adding new ones (if entered name already exists)

if possible, reduce the number of same models. I.E. If possible keep only one clientModel instead of 1 per interface.

When counting cash before the session only display crosses next to names only if mouse hover over it

 Q_DECLARE_METATYPE() qRegisterMetaType<T>() to simplify connects between carte and orderModel

!!no null name for anything + max name length.

maybe throw custom QSqlException in case of error ?

Balance of an account can be slightly ngative and appear as -0.00.
