2) What happens if we delete a session from salesessions but it is still in config as current session ? -> Trigger "Cannot delete current session."

4) Have only some basic commands in Database and have all the specifications (client, articles, ...) in the corresponding classes.
   We could have (in database or so) an enum for the fields of such classes

5) Date d'ouverture de la session dans la barre en bas.
   Musique dans la barre en bas
   Current jobist share dans la barre en bas ?

Edit carte : disable "Validate" if no article selected

RGPD, do not display client's infos unless password entered ?

Make 2 executables. Gui and (cli ?) config.
Config executable : Only by sudo/admin or ask for pin ?
Asks for pin
allow changes of pin and other passes
Select money and number of different notes and coins and their value

TODO deal with already existing clients when adding new ones (if entered name already exists)

if possible, reduce the number of same models. I.E. If possible keep only one clientModel instead of 1 per interface.

!!no null name for anything + max name length.

maybe throw custom Exception in case of error ?

Ask to confirm / count cash before auto closing session ?

As many customizable parameters as possible like :
lowest pay for a sale session
negative limit for an account
Could allow several profiles for client (like client, jobist, table,...)

Save paid/validated sessions.
Have toe possibility to check past sessions and if neeed export them. CSV or TXT or... something else

Store successive state of articles after modifications so that we keep an internal history of it accross time.
Delete history entry when not useful anymore

could have a trigger in the database.
After writing to a field in config we execute many querries that cleanup database like deleting history entries ?

Add a history of cash moves associated to each client account

Intercept close event and ask if we really want to quit if the cash register not counted after.

Could force free orders to select an account ?
